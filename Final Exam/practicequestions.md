# Templates
Certainly! Here are four programming questions related to C++ templates. Remember, I won't provide the answers, but feel free to tackle these challenges:

1. **Template Function for Doubling Values**:
   - Write a template function called `multiplyByTwo()` that multiplies a given value by two.
   - Test this function with integers, doubles, and strings (by repeating the string twice).

2. **Template Class for Stack**:
   - Create a template class called `Stack` that implements a basic stack data structure.
   - The stack should support operations like `push()`, `pop()`, and `top()`.
   - Test your `Stack` class with different data types (e.g., `int`, `double`, or custom objects).

3. **Template Function for Finding Maximum Value**:
   - Implement a template function called `findMax()` that finds the maximum value in an array.
   - Test it with arrays of integers, doubles, and custom objects.

4. **Partial Specialization for Custom Containers**:
   - Define a template class called `MyContainer` that represents a container for elements of type `T`.
   - Partially specialize `MyContainer` for specific types (e.g., `char`, `bool`, etc.).
   - Customize behavior for these specialized cases.

Feel free to work on these questions, and happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
# LinkedList
Certainly! Let's dive into some questions related to the provided **linked list** code. I'll ask you three questions to test your understanding:

1. **Insertion After a Specific Node:**
   - Suppose you have a linked list with the following elements: `1 -> 6 -> 7 -> 4 -> 2`.
   - You want to insert a new node with the value `8` after the node with value `7`.
   - How would you modify the `insertAfter` method in the `LinkedList` class to achieve this?

2. **Finding a Node by Value:**
   - Given the same linked list as above, how would you find the node with value `4` using the `getNode` method?
   - What would be the expected output if you print the value of the found node?

3. **Deleting a Node:**
   - Continuing with the same linked list, you've already inserted the node with value `8` after the node with value `7`.
   - Now you want to delete the node with value `4`.
   - How would you modify the `deletNode` method in the `LinkedList` class to correctly remove the node with value `4`?

Feel free to answer these questions, and I'll provide feedback! ðŸ˜Š
